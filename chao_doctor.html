<font color="#000066"><b>A MESSAGE FROM THE CHAO DOCTOR<BR>
I get back from vacation, and what's this? 2,629 emails! How wonderful! Since it's impossible to answer every email, I've read a good chunk and decided to answer the most common of questions for now. Most of your problems seem to stem from Creating Chao Send Data files for use in the Chao Daycare and for Evaluation. Although it may be difficult at first, it will be second nature once you've got it to work once. Also, please remember that the upload file is 11 blocks big, so make sure there is room on your VMU!<p>
Anyway, on to the letters!

<b>JAPANESE VMU</b><br>

I need help. I have a Japanese VMU, it saves my
games and it looks like it saves my chao,
because when I'm in the game I can load my
chao, but when I go to your website and go to
evaluate my chao and load it from my VMU it
tells me no files found, is it because it's a
japanese VMU or is my chao to young to be
evaluared I only gave it 4 animals please help.
<p>
Rod
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>No Rod, that's not the problem. Problem is that you have not made an Upload File. To make an upload file, when you put your Chao in the Chao Machine, do so by pressing and holding Y+A until you hear a ringing sound. Of course, you will need an extra 11 blocks of space on your VMU to do so. That should clear up any confusion. Just think of it like making a Send Data file for World Rankings, only using Chao in the Chao Machine. Good luck!</b></font>
<p>
<b>5 Questions</b><br>
I have a few questions

1. What are the different ways of hatching a
Chao?

2. When I give my Chao an annimal it gets an
exlamation point over its head and kicks it off
does that mean it didn't accept it?

3. How will I know when it is an adult?

4. How do I get my Chao to get friends?

5. And finaly what is the purpose of Chao
daycare?        

<p>

<font color="blue"><b>Okay, here we go:<p>

<b>Hatching a Chao</b><br>
You can hatch Chao by throwing the egg, hugging the egg, or waiting for it to hatch by itself ... your Chao's personality and traits can be affected depending on how you hatch them. Try and experiment on the best way to hatch one... my suggestion is to keep from throwing it.
<p>
<b>Animal Rejection</b><br>
I guess your Chao doesn't like that animal, or it could be mad at you as well. Try giving it some fruit... if it rejects that too, then yes, it is mad at you. Be nice next time.
<p>
<b>When is it an Adult?</b><br>
Chao go through evolutionary stages. They cocoon to signify entering another evolutionary stage. Chao usually evolve twice... here's how it goes: egg > baby > cocoon (evolve) > young chao > cocoon (evolve 2) > adult <p>
afterwards... they either reincarnate or pass away. This is all depending on how you treat it.<p>
<b>Friends</b><br>
When you do a Chao VMU Battle or VMU Marriage, your owner information is shared between a chao and it's new friend.... it will now know who your friend is!
<p>
<b>Chao Daycare: Purpose</b><br>
The Chao Daycare is available for you to be able to share your Chao with other Chao Trainers and Breeders all over the world!

<b>WHY WHY WHY!!!!????</b><br>

why will my choa not win races even though hisstats are all over 200 and
 i have finished choa adventure.

200!? Even though it is a strong and fast Chao, a Chao with 200+ stats still has alot of room to grow, and there are also still many Chao out there that are far more superior in strength and speed. Try training some more. As far as Chao Adventure is concerned, it's like taking your Chao for a walk. You're never really done even though you've gone through once. Good luck and happy training!</b></font>

<b>SWIMMING IN THE AIR!</b><br>


Recently, I have realized that I canmot get
send data for a Chao that I got from the
Daycare.  Whenever I try, it still makes the
"coin" sound, but it never shows up in list of
files.  Is this normal, or is something wrong?



       
<p>
Sniper
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Sniper, check to see if you have enough empty space on your VMU to save the file. 11 blocks should be sufficient. Otherwise, it will make the sound but when it tries to save, there will be no space to save it to and the process is aborted. Have fun!</b></font>
<p>
<b>CHAO JEWELRY? </b><br>



Dear doc c<p>
Recently I have noticed that one of my chao (my
nights chao) doesnt walk it floats around.And I
have also noticed that some of my chaos have a
green jewel on their stomachs,but some arent
completely green.What do these things mea?
Id also like to say that you rule.                 

<p>
Jarid Gille
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Ah, so you noticed the jewelry on the Chao's necks! This is an award from a Chao Race! If your Chao compete and win a Chao Race it will win a jewel that it lovingly adorns on it's neck as a triumphant reminder. Try to get all the jewels! 
<p>
Oh, and about the floating... this is your Chao testing out it's wings! Don't worry, it won't float away.
