<p>
<b>VMU LOCK-UP</b><br>
When I was breeding two chaos in VMUs, one of
the VMUs locked up and now just displays "Keep
Connect."  How do I "unlock" it to get my chao
back?  I hope I didn't lose it!
<p>
Aaron Karp
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>Aaron, what an unfortunate incident! However, there is a way to recover. Take the pointy side of a pen (or something similar) and push the RESET button on the back of the VMU (it's in a small hole on the left side of the battery cover). That should unlock your VMU and you will not lose any data!</b></font>
<p>
<b>RESCUED ANIMALS</b><br>
how do you introduce animals you ruscue to your
chao?       
<p>
Caotic
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Ah, back to Chao 101. Take a character (Sonic or anyone else) and go through an action stage. When you defeat any of Doctor Robotnik's creatures, an animal will be saved from it. Pick up the animal and you will see it pop up on the bottom right of your screen. After you clear the level, go into the Chao Garden and you will see all the collected animals released into the garden! Please note that you cannot do this if you selected TRIAL as your game mode.</b></font>
<p>
<b>DELETED CHAO!</b><br>
Hello! I accidently deleted my chao file and when I went back on Sonic I had to begin again. Is there any way I can get my special chao back without starting Sonic Adventure again?
<p>
Joanna Nuckowski
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Oh Joanna! What happened! I'm sorry to report that if you delete the 28 block Chao Garden file or if you delete a 128 block Chao Adventure file containing a Chao that it is lost forever! You can, however, delete a 128 block Chao Adventure file AFTER you have taken your Chao back into the Chao Garden. Hey, at least it's fun to start over!</b></font>
<p>
<b>SUMO CHAO</b><br>
I've heard rumours of a sumo chao. Is this true, and if so, how do I get him? 

<p>
G. Miller
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Ah, the Sumo Chao! Here's a hint... pay attention... Chao evolve depending on what animals it is given. Certain animals share characteristics (i.e., swimming, running, etc..). If you give a Chao a certain characteristic enough times, it will evolve to a shape that can better take advantage of that characteristic (i.e., Water Chao, Sonic Chao, etc.). After a Chao's first evolution, you can give it a different characteristic and it will eventually evolve again! The key to a Sumo Chao? Swimming > Power. Good luck!</b></font>
<p>
<b>TEMPER, TEMPER</b><br>
why does my chao keep having tantrums? he keeps lying on his back and crying.i keep him fully fed. he is a gold chao and is 1 year  old.please help!
<p>
David Horner
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
David, Chao can be tempermental sometimes. Keep it well fed (try feeding it until it falls asleep... they love that!), give it plenty of hugs, and it should do fine.</b></font>
<p>
<b>HUGGING GOOD NiGHTS</b><br>
Where on earth do you find the NiGHTS chao? I've searched for ages and ages but to no
avail, please help! Also, could you tell me how to hug/cuddle a chao?   

<p>
mpugh1
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
A NiGHTS Chao is bred, not found! I hear purple is it's favorite color. If you want to hug a Chao, just pick it up with the Y button, and keep the button pressed! Then, move the analog stick in any direction to hug it! To put the Chao down, just let go of the analog stick and press Y.
</b></font>
<p>
<b>LIFENUTS</b><br>
Is there any way to increase my chances of winning a lifenut in the matching game?  

<p>
Jester
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Try beating the matching game without one mistake and you might improve your chances for better fruit! It may be a bit hard on the brain but the payoff is sweet! Good luck!
</b></font>
<p><b>CHAO OVERPOPULATION</b><br>
What's Up Doc?  I bet you get that a lot. Well My chao are mating like crazy
one even had 2 eggs. I am having trouble knowing what to do? I am running
out of space in my gardens. Also is there a limit on how many times a chao
can mate? Because I noticed that when I mated one twice he went back to the
egg stage.  
<p>
Rich
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Rich, I do get that alot! You can have up to 8 Chao per Garden and you have 3 Gardens: Station Square, Mystic Ruins and Egg Carrier. This means you can have up to 24 Chao! That's alot of Chao, and alot of work for the Breeder! If you have 24 Chao that are doing well and still don't think you have your hands full, then that would surely qualify you as being one of the best Chao Breeders in the world!</b></font>

<p><b>LAZYNUTS</b><br>
What do lazynuts do?
Is it possible to dump them?   
<p>
gmorgan12
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Lazynuts, eww.. these don't make your Chao feel too good. Dump them? Hmmmm... 
</b></font>
<p><b>FROM ADULT TO EGG!!</b><br>
I have reached the max with my choa but for
some reason it wii go back to a egg an become a
baby again WHAT IS GOING ON????    

<p>
Marlon Riley
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Marlon, your Chao has reincarnated! It has finished it's life cycle and since you've treated it so well it wishes to stay with you and go through life all over again! Keep it going, I hear something great can happen with Chao that have reincarnated multiple times.
</b></font>
<p>
<b>BLACK AND GOLD = BROWN!</b><br>
doc, why is it WHEN i mated a black and gold
chao a brown one came out? is it a special chao
like the light chao?

Adrienne Johnson

You have created a new Chao! Chao share it's parents' characteristics. Try and mix other colors and see what you get!
