<font color="#000066"><b>A MESSAGE FROM THE CHAO DOCTOR<BR>
Thank you everyone who has sent me email about the special Chao. This Chao has been given many names, from "Joker Chao" to "Elf Chao" (my personal favorite). I must say that I was overwhelmed by all the recipes for Chao that I have received. The winner? Clinton Dziki! Clinton was the first to correctly outline how to breed the "Elf Chao". Thanks Clinton, you will be receiving an email from a representative at Sega. Please reply with your Full Name, Mailing Address and Age and I will make sure you receive your new cool Plush Chao! <p>
For those of you who would like to know how to breed the "Elf Chao", here is Clinton's recipe:<p>
                               


<img src="../../images/chao/sonic_nights_chao.gif" height=100 width=100 hspace=10 align=left><font color="#000000">Give a
newborn chao green system animals (rabbits,
deer, and kangaroos). When it evolves, it will
be a speed chao. Now, give this chao purple
system animals (birds)  till it looks like the
picture.<p> (I like to call this chao the elf
chao, but mine is purple.)</font>
<p>
<font color="#000066">Well Clinton, in your honor, we have named this Chao the Elf Chao.

<font color="blue"><b>Make sure that there is enough memory on your VMU (11 blocks) to create the Chao Upload file. You will know you did it when you see a SONICADV_H07 file in your VMU.</b></font>

To give you a hint of what's coming, take a look at this wonderful Emerald Jewel Chao! Yes sir, rare and exotic Chao are coming soon! Do you have enough emblems?

<b>AFFECTION?</b><br>
what dos affection mean caus when i went to the
fun room and sent my chaos data it said 25%
affection    
<p>
Ramsey Cook
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
A Chao's affection percentage determines how happy it is. Just make sure your Chao has plenty of exercise, rest, gets lots of hugs and eats lots of fruit and it will be just fine.</b></font>
<p>
<b>ARTISTIC CHAO</b><br>
my chao drew a pitchure and it was tails and i
met tails in chao aventure whats going on?
<p>
the_real_max  
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Your Chao draws it's favorite Sonic Character. Its favorite character is the character that spends the most time with and takes the best care of it. For instance, I can tell that you use Tails to take care of that Chao because it likes Tails alot! How do you get a Chao to draw? Simple, give it a couple of skunks... they may smell funny but I hear they have a good eye.</b></font>
<p>
<b>THREE QUESTIONS</b><br>
1:why cant i e-mail you out of sonic homepage?<br>
2:HOW DO I NAME MY CHAO?<br>
3:why cant i get my chao on my vms? how much space does it use?
<p>
Jef
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Here are your answers:<p>
1. you should be able to<br>
2. put your Chao in the VMU and name it there.<br>
3. you need 128 blocks of memory in your VMU.</b></font>
<p>
<b>NiGHTS AND SUMO CHAO... WHERE??</b><br>
I have been looking all over for the knights chao and also where is the
sumo .

<p>
Alex Dickinson    
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Alex, you need to breed these Chao, not find them. Here's a refresher course:<p>
When you play an action stage, you can save animals that Dr. "Eggman" Robotnik has turned into robots. These animals have characteristics. If you take these saved animals into the Chao Garden and infuse them with your Chao, your Chao will adapt these characteristics. Give them enough animals of the same characteristic and your Chao will evolve into a form that can better take advantage of these characteristics. You can get many different combinations this way. The NiGHTS Chao's combination is FLYING > FLYING, while the Sumo Chao is SWIMMING > POWER. Good luck, and happy parenting!</b></font>
