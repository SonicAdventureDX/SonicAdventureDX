Questions and Answers from the Chao Doctor.<p>

<p>
<b>DAYCARE?</b><br>
if i upload my chao,does he delete from my
VMU,and can i get him back if it does?     
<p>
Marc Montalbano
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>Uploading your Chao to daycare just means putting a copy of it up for other people to enjoy. You can put your Chao in the Daycare, and afterwards pull it out of the VMU and play with it.</b></font>
<p>
<b>AWARDS</b><br>
At the evaluation page it says there are
awards, what are they and how do I get them.    
<p>
Sega Havoc
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
First of all, I love the name! Awards are jewels that the Chao collect by winning the Chao Races. Try to collect them all!</b></font>
<p>
<b>INVALID EMAIL ADDRESS</b><br>
I have tried to upload info, and keep getting
an invalid e-mail message.  I checked under
options, and everything is right.  Any ideas
Doc?     
<p>
Nathan A. Smeltzer
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Hmmm. If your email address looks right on your email setup, check to make sure there are no spaces before or after your email address. Those innocuous little spaces could cause problems! Good luck!</b></font>
<p>
<b>ACTIONS AND NAMES</b><br>
i named 1 dali and it paints.
r there any other special names?
DO THEY ALL PAINT?
WHATS WITH THE WEIRD EMAIL?
THANKS    

<p>
Billy Carlile Jr.
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Billy, that's certainly a wonderful coincidence! Actually, the animals you infuse with your Chao determine the characteristics that are imbued onto them. For example, after a couple of skunks your Chao will paint! There are many funny little actions Chao can learn, can you find them all? Wierd email? Oh, you must mean the Chao Heart email! Well, when you send your Chao for an Evaluation, they send you a little note of how they're doing and what they're feeling. Interesting stuff indeed.
</b></font>
<p>
<b>CHAO ADVENTURE TRIPS</b><br>
when i play the chao mini game, why does he
fall over and how can i stop it?   

<p>
Elaine Cadiz
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Elaine, your Chao is probably a young one. To get your Chao back up after it trips, hit the A button on your VMU. After awhile it will learn to walk a bit better, but watch out for several other distractions!
</b></font>
<p>
<b>RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</b><br>
How do I get into launch party if i have a chao
on my vmu?  It keeps telling me I don't have
enough memory.  Help!        

<p>
L Platero
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
You've got to learn a little resource management. Take your Chao out of the VMU and into the Garden, then you can delete the 128 block Chao file. Afterwards, you're free to enjoy the Launch Party. When you're done, delete the Launch Party download and resume playing with your Chao!
</b></font>
<p>
<b>LOST IN THE DAYCARE</b><br>
Hey I put my email address in but it can't find
my chao, and I tried many different things many
times. Why won't it work?       

<p>
Chris
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
We only take care of Chao for 24 hours. It's a daycare, not an orphanage! =P 
</b></font>
<p>
<b>THE INFAMOUS BLACK MARKET</b><br>
i got 100+emblems arent i supossed to get a
black market option help!    

<p>
Rosemary Weiland
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Ah, another question about the Black Market. The Chao Black Market is a wonderful store where you can purchase exotic and rare Chao using your Emblems as currency. The Black Market will be up soon, and in the meantime, there are still more Emblems to collect! Patience folks, the rarest and most exotic Chao are still to come!</b></font>
<p>
<b>CHAKU RON</b><br>
There is a choa that is named Chaclon, he is a
baby choa like mine, he always goes to sleep at
the beginning of the race, then in the middle
of the race he wakes up runs on two feet faster
than any choa I've seen, he is always against
me in every race. How can he do all of that.
PLEASE ANSWER!!!!!!!!!

<p>
Gary Bauerle
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Seems as though you've found Chaku Ron! There are some very tough adversaries in the Chao racing circuit, and you've just encountered one of them! Just when you think your Chao is the most powerful out there, out come these powerful and mysterious foes.
</b></font>
<p>
<b>INFO TO SHARE</b><br>
To all chao care givers:
Have you noticed when you download another
owners info of there chao there name is always
a metalic color.  Showing that it is a copy to
give the name color again when you get animals
give one or two to the chao you downloaded.
Then what happens it becomes an egg when it
hatches the name is in color and the chao has
the same features it had before. I tested this
on a chao with a average of 600 in every
catergory.  Anyway just thought I share this.

<p>
Erik Handrahan
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Nice detective work Erik! Anyone else have anything to share?
</b></font>
<p>
<b>SLEEPY, SLEEPY CHAO</b><br>
How do I keep my chao from being sleepy all the
time. Its pretty annoying when I want to race
them. Please help.

<p>
Nick Silva 
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Nick, you gotta give your Chao some rest. If you are seeing your Chao sleep during a race, it's a good indication that it's not well rested. In the Garden, if you see your Chao yawn or act sleepy, give it a Chaonut or two! Wait until after it has awakened before you try and race it. That should improve it's performance!
</b></font>
<p>
<b>ANIMAL COLOR TYPES</b><br>
Dear Chao Doctor:
I have noticed that whenever I give my chao so
many types of animals from a certain color
group, it's overall color changes, along with
it's appearance!  Is there a pattern with
animal types?

<p>
Brandon Standifer
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Brandon, I think you're beginning to catch on to something! You should see how far the transformation goes!
</b></font>
<p>
<b>CHAO APPEARANCE... HOW???</b><br>
how do you get your chaos to look like those
cool chaos that are the opponents in the races?
or like that chao in all those pictures on the
website?  
<p>
Henry Neels
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Henry, the answer is simple. Lots of love, lots of care, lots of food, lots of animals, and lots of experimentation! Good luck!
