Questions and Answers from the Chao Doctor.<p>

<p>
<b>OLD AGE CHAO</b><br>
MY CHAO DIED EVEN THOUGH I HAD 999 ON
EVERYTHING AND THE HP WAS 52/52. HOW DID IT
DIE? CAN IT DIE OF OLD AGE?    
<p>
Cynthia Reynolds
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>Yes, Chao get old and unfortunately, they expire. If you treat them well, they will revert to an egg, if not, they will pass away. Try breeding them to pass on some of it's heritage.</b></font>
<p>
<b>WALK WALK WALK</b><br>
why does my chaos always crawl instead of walk
like the other chaos he races? He stands up when he is in the gardens. He
even runs.Why wont he do this in the race? I have the black chaos from the ship.
all his skills are way over a hundred.Can you
help me out?I am tired of loosing the races
because he wont get up and run.

Your Chao may still be a baby! Try evaluating it and see how old it is. Also, put it in your VMU and take it for a walk to work out those little feet. Good luck!</b></font>
<p>
<b>THAT MYSTERIOUS CHAO HEART EMAIL</b><br>
After you have one of your Choas evaluated and
the Choa sends you an Email, what does it mean
if your Chao writes, "P.S. i'm ready to give
up"? What could I do to help whatever it is?    
<p>
Steve Marks
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Steve, Chao say what they feel at the moment they are evaluated, and sometimes it doesn't mean much. Just make sure you take good care of your Chao and all should be fine. Let them think whatever they want to think!</b></font>
<p>
<b>FRIENDLESS CHAO</b><br>
When I got my chao evaluated, he sent me an
e-mail. In the e-mail, he said he wanted
friends. How can I get him a friend

<p>
Alex
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Ah, your Chao is lonely! Put him in a VMU, and go over to a friend who has a Chao in his VMU. Engage in a friendly Chao Battle or Marry your Chao and voila: your Chao has made a friend! You can't really blame them, it's pretty dark and lonely inside a Dreamcast when you're sleeping or in school.
</b></font>
<p>
<b>ANGRY CHAO!</b><br>
Whenever I win a fruit on the VMU minigame I
try to give him a fruit, but he just kicks it
away and sometimes he kicks away chaonuts and
starnuts! What do I do?   

<p>
Claude Nasse
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Uh oh, you've got an angry Chao! You must have done something to make your Chao mad at you because it won't even eat! Give it lots of hugs, lots of food (if it is willing to eat) and lots of attention. My, they do get little attitudes, don't they?
</b></font>
<p>
<b>MORE DAYCARE TROUBLES</b><br>
I loaded my chao in the vmu but when I try to
put it in daycare it says FILE NOT FOUND,what
do I do?        

<p>

I get millions of email about this same question. When you are about to put your Chao in the Chao Machine (VMU), push and hold Y+A until you hear a "RING" sound. It is important that you have 11 blocks free for the Chao Send Data file. That should do it. Good luck!
