Questions and Answers from the Chao Doctor.<p>

<p>
<b>999 AND LIGHT CHAO</b><br>
How do parents get their chaos to 999? it would take me forever.  And what is a light chao, I keep hearing people mention.  And are there any more chaos other than, normal, silver, gold and black.
<p>
PORNCAT
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>To get your Chao up to 999 is a great accomplishment indeed! But remember, the reward is not in the accomplishment, but in the fun you have while getting there! This isn't work, you know.<p><img src="../../images/chao/light_chao.gif" width=100 height=100 border=0 alt="" hspace=5 align=left> You've heard of the Light Chao I presume. A light Chao is a very rare and special Chao indeed. Here is a picture of one of my specimens. Ah, a beautiful creature. I hear that every few generations it will show up. <p>Your friend says hello!</b></font>
<p>
<b>BREEDING AND EGG CARRIER CHAO</b><br>
I havent had chao for long and was wondering how to breed them.  Also, in the prison on the egg carrier I found an egg, but I couldnt take it to the garden!!!  Help me!!!  
<p>
Greg
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Greg, when you rescue the egg in Egg Carrier (that sounds funny), take it to a door all the way to the end. There, you will find a transporter that will take you to the Egg Carrier Chao Garden. You now have an exotic Black Chao! For breeding, when your Chao is ready, it will sit down and a bed of flowers will sprout around it. Place a mature Chao in the flowerbed and a new Chao Egg will appear! You can also marry two Chao via the VMU! Happy parenting!</b></font>
<p>
<b>COLOR BLIND CHAO</b><br>
Hi,

ive been trying to get my to change but he dont
i give him lotta hugs hes never tired hes kept
in good shape but no color change.. HELPP
ME!!!!!!!!       
<p>
Saiyen
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Hugs make your Chao happy and enhance it's affection percentage, but to change your Chao's color, you will need the help of rescued animals. Take the animals you rescue from various stages and introduce them to your Chao. If you are consistent your Chao will change color! HINT: color color color... watch those animals!</b></font>
<p>
<b>WHAT'S WITH THE TEETH?</b><br>
I want to know why some chaos have teeth

<p>
James
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
James, Chao have to eat y'know? The way Chao display their teeth is in their personality. Some Chao like to give it a big grin and show them to the world, while others are a bit more reclusive with their chompers.</b></font>
<p>
<b>CHAO DISAPPEARING ACT</b><br>
i used to have 9 chao... 5 in station square,4
in mystic ruins. i quit-- then changed to
knuckles, went into the chao garden, and all my
chao were gone, except the one in the vmu. what
happened?????

Interesting indeed. Are you using a different Save File? If so, then you will be in a different Garden. Also, be careful that you don't erase the 28 block Chao file, it contains all your Chao! Good luck finding your Chao!</b></font>
<p>
<b>FROM OLD TO EGG???</b><br>
hey doc!
my chao formed into a cocoon today,and when it came out,it was an egg!it
 had the same name and characteristics,but had much less skill.it was af
ter it had mated for the 2nd time.whats going on?did it die of old age?    

<p>

Your Chao has reincarnated! What does this mean!? It means that you were a good Chao Breeder! If you treated it poorly it would have disappeared! Congratulations to a new long life with your Chao!

<p>
<b>CRYPTIC DRAWINGS ON THE FLOOR</b><br>
what does the image of Sonic on the floor in
the garden signify?                         

<p>
Scott Page
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Your Chao is in a drawing mood! And what is it drawing? It's favorite Character! Apparently your Chao really likes Sonic. Try raising a Chao with another character and see what drawings come up!
</b></font>
<p><b>VMU SPACE: THE FINAL FRONTIER</b><br>
so i got a chao on my vmu, and it's taking up
some 150 blocks.  now i dont want to delete my
chao but i need more memory, and the chao's 150
some blocks are still taking up space after i
dropped him off in the chao gardens.  can i get
rid of all those filled blocks without deleting
my chao?

<p>
Andrew
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Andrew, to make space, take your Chao out of the VMU and into the Chao Garden, then go to File Options (X+Y+A+B until you get to the menu) and delete the 128 block Chao file. You can also delete the 11 block Upload file if you are finished with it. Voila! More room on your VMU!</b></font>

<p><b>CREATING THE SONIC CHAO</b><br>
Dear Chao Doctor, can you tell me how I can make my chao resemble the coolest hedgehog in the world, SONIC?  
<p>
mmcclaff2
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Ah, I get this question alot! In order to be a Master Chao Breeder you need to pay attention to what animals you're introducing your Chao to! Look carefully at each animal... they all have characteristics right? Now think Sonic... what is his special characteristic... hmmmm... can you introduce your Chao to animals of the same characteristics as Sonic? Once you figure this out, you can pretty much create other kinds of Wonderful Chao! Good luck!
</b></font>
<p><b>THE CHAO IN THE ANTIQUE SHOP</b><br>
chao doctor i need help !!! ive managed to get two silver secret chaos! and ive also managed to get two black secret chaos! but how do you get the green egg in station   square from the antique shop!? but when i pick up the egg the shuters close on me and i cant get out. i know this isnt really a breeding question but please help me sir. 

<p>
Hannibal Lodge
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Hannibal... when you try to pick up the Chao Egg the doors close don't they? Hmmm... what if you replaced the egg with another object of a similar weight and size? Maybe then, the doors won't close! 
</b></font>
<p><b>FROZEN VMU FROM CHAO BREEDING</b><br>
when i downloaded a chao from daycare. and
tried breeding using vmu connection. the other
vmu is now stuck on "keep connect." The vmu is
now "frozen." The other vmu with the downloaded
chao data still says "CHAO Download Data." What
did I do wrong?
                  

<p>
Bruce & Jennifer Lord
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
Before you can marry Chao that have been downloaded from Daycare, first you need to place them in your Chao Garden to recouperate from the trip through the internet! After a short time (give it a minute or two), you can put that Chao in a VMU and then it can be ready to mate. Remember, go to the game menu and hit the MATE option on Chao Adventure for both VMUs before you connect them. Did you know you can also wait for the Chao to be ready to mate in the Garden?
</b></font>
<p><b>HP... IT'S NOT HEWLETT PACKARD IS IT?</b><br>
what does hp mean in the vmu?      

<p>
William Scott
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
HP means Hit Points. In Chao Adventure, you need to keep your Chao's stats above zero so he can survive. If your Chao's HP reaches Zero, it is toast.
</b></font>
<p><b>MORE CHAO... ARE THERE?</b><br>
Hey doc, I was just wondering if it was possible
to find any other chaos on the adventure fields
besides the black one in the Egg Carrier jail.
Also, what's the quickest way to raise your
Chao's stats?    

<p>
David Creaturo
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
David, you can find other Chao in the Adventure Fields... you just really have to look hard! The quickest way to raise your Chao's stats? Hmmm... raising Chao is about patience and exploration and fun. The fun is in getting there, not when it's finished.
