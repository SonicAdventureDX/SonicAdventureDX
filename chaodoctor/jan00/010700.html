<font color="#000066"><b>A MESSAGE FROM THE CHAO DOCTOR<BR>
Everyone is talking about the Chao Black Market these days. What's going on with that? Well, we are coming along nicely and I am creating a wonderful batch of beautiful Chao as well. That said, the market is still not ready. Soon, very soon. <p>
Please take the time to read this edition of letters. There are some great questions from Zro about File Management and it can really be helpful. On to the letters!</font>

<b>I CAN'T GET THE DARN SONIC CHAO</b><br>
I've given my chao at least 20 animals that
improve it's running.I still don't have a sonic
chao.HELP!!!!!!!

<font color="blue"><b>Asher, you're going to need more than 20 animals. Keep them coming. Good luck on your Sonic Chao!</b></font>

<b>CHAO RULE!</b><br>
Hi. Chao Doctor, I got the Black Chao from the Egg carrier, and when I
gave it 20 animals from the yelow section, it changed colour! How come t
his doesn't happen to gold & Silver Chao? It would be pretty cool to hav
e a blue-metallic Chao, then I could call him Mecha-Sonic! Also, I have
a blue Chao with Sonic-like spikes, ears, and a cute little smile, and t
he exact same but it's golden! I called him Super-sonic! Will you be abl
e to get Chao action figures, plushies, and duvet-covers in the shops? B
ecause Chao rules!

<font color="blue"><b>Yes, Chao do rule! You can find Chao stuff on the Sega store (http://store.sega.com) and also at fine toy shops and game shops as well. </b></font>
<p>
<b>ON THE RIGHT TRACK</b><br>
Doc, please put my mind at rest! I have a young gold chao, which was constantly introduced to  yellow category animals until it first evolved...
Since then i have kept on using red animals. Will my chao change shape/color? It already hasa long, streamlined head!

If you're trying to get your Chao to morph into something cool, you are definitely on the right track! Try other combinations to get different kinds of Chao!</b></font>

<b>SWIMMING IN THE AIR!</b><br>
HELP docter.c!
my chao has gone swimming in the air! i know   the differance between flying and swimming and chao's can't fly the backstroke!!! also could   you list all the differant types of chao? is a scorpian chao an official type? 
<p>

<p>
<font color="blue"><b>
That is certainly a special attribute for a Chao to have! As far as different classifications of Chao, there are many. Create and name your own! This is really more about your Chao than it is anyone else's. </b></font>
<p>
<b>LONG LETTER FROM ZRO</b><br>
Hello Doc. I have several questions that
i'm hopeing you could ask.
<P>
What animals do i need to make a light chao
& which chao is best for the job (silver,
black, gold, or the plain color(I have gone
over the previous letters and i dont understand
the swimmimng>power and all of that all i know
is that if i give one an animal it will change
but to what i dont know so if you would please
tell me how to make the light chao i will be
very thankful))
<p>
My vmu reads:<BR>    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free 093<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Game 093<P>

I have only sonic saved files. (I really dont
care to much for the game since ive beat it and
all I just want to settle down and raise some
chao.
<P>
Saved Files<BR>
SONICADV_ALF (HIGHLIGHTED)<BR>
SONICADV_506<BR>
SONICADV_H07 (HIGHLIGHTED)<BR>
SONICADV_INT<P>

NO SAVED GAMES
<P>
Now when I put the chao in the little walk the 
chao machine it says copy failed now reffering
back to one of your previous letters a person
asks about the chao vmu and how much space does
it use and all you answered was the space
question. So how do i get a vmu game with the
chao and how do i operate it (is it like a digi
mon type thing?) Can you plaese tell me the
nesseary procedures on how to get the chao on
my vmu? (In doing this I would like to keep
Knuckles because all my chao are starting to
like him. Can I keep knuckles if there is any
erasing involved on the vmu)
<P>
I hope i havent wasted to much of your time.
And i would really love it if you can help me
out with these problems.              

<p>

Intelligent questions indeed! Okay, Here are your answers:
<P>
1. SWIMMING > POWER explanation<br>
Basically, each animal that you can rescue from the Sonic Adventure game can be classified into specific character traits. For example, bunnies and deer share RUNNING qualities where elephants and lions share POWER qualities. If you give your Chao one specific characteristic enough times, it will evolve into a shape that would be better at that characteristic! Eventually, it will cocoon and emerge as an adult with even more distinct changes depending on characteristics! Now, you can opt to give it more of the same characteristic, or change characteristics to get a Combo Chao! The example above shows you how to create a Sumo Chao! 
<p>
2. VMU File Management<br>
Okay, looks like you have 93 blocks left on your VMU! You are getting a COPY FAILED error putting a Chao in your VMU because you need more space! You will have to delete a file to make enough for Chao Adventure. First, let's identify which files are which:<p>
SONICADV_INT&nbsp;&nbsp;(10 blocks)<br>
This is your main save file. Don't delete this!<p>

SONICADV_ALF&nbsp;&nbsp;(28 blocks)<br>
This is your A-Life File (ALF, get it?). This contains all the information for all your Chao in all your Chao Gardens. Don't delete this either! <p>

SONICADV_506&nbsp;&nbsp;(68 blocks)<br>
This is a Minigame Event Download file. This particular one is for Sonic2k: Treasure Hunt. You can delete this file after you are finished competing. If you want to download a Holiday Event File, you need to delete this as well. Only one Event File at a time can be stored.<p>

SONICADV_H07&nbsp;&nbsp;(11 blocks)<br>
This is your World Rankings Upload file! This file was created when you pushed the secret handshake at the file select menu (Y+A). You can delete this after you have uploaded your time to World Rankings.<p>

Looking at all your files, it seems most logical to erase the SONICADV_506 file in order to put your Chao in your VMU. You can always download the Event Minigame from the website when you are finished. If your Chao like Knuckles, just choose Knuckles from the Adventure menu and you can still have him take care of your Chao.
<P>
3. The Light Chao<br>
Let's just say that a Light Chao shows up every few generations in a lineage of diverse Chao. Am I being vague? Not really. You can figure it out! Good luck, and thanks for the wonderful questions!
