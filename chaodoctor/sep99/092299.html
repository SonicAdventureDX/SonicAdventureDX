Questions and Answers from the Chao Doctor.<p>

<p>
<b>TANTRUMS</b><br>
how come it seems like I can't keep these guys
happy.  I feed them and give them hugs but they
still throw fits.   
<p>
Jose
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>Jose, good question! Chao can be just like children sometimes. And as you know, kids can be pretty whiny (just look at the boards)! Anyway, make sure you feed it lots of chaonuts and other fruit (for variety), give it lots of hugs and make sure it's well rested before you race it. Now you know how your parents must feel! Happy parenting!</b></font>
<p>
<b>MISLEADING CHAO</b><br>
My Chao has a heart symbol over his head,but he
seem angry if you look at his face. His eyes
are slanted,like he is mad; his mouth is all
contorted too...like S's that are side ways. Is
he really mad or is it just his face? Help!!!

<font color="blue"><b>
Chris, Chao faces are pretty much set in stone depending on how you treat it for the beginning of it's life. Be specially careful how you hatch them and treat them early on. Then again, at times it's just their personality! Do you know a friend that's always mad looking, no matter what? It's just their disposition, I guess.</b></font>
<p>
<b>SUPER STRONG CHAO LOSS</b><br>
My chaos levels are all at 999,but i always
lose a certain race. What's the problem?

<font color="blue"><b>
Mitch, you can't win 'em all! It would be unfair for your strong Chao to be put up against weak ones, and quite frankly, your Chao needs to be challenged. Besides, there are some tough foes in the races... have you met any of them?</b></font>
<p>
<b>DAYCARE TROUBLES</b><br>
i still can't load my chao in the gardens. what
is going on? why won't it work? i heard the
"ring".

Jamie Hanks

Jamie, take a look at your VMU space. You need 11 blocks for Chao Data. If you hear the ring and you don't see a "Chao Upload" file in your VMU, then you need to clear some room. Also, it's important to note that the Chao Data will be saved in the same memory card as your Main Save file, regardless of what VMU you put your Chao in.
